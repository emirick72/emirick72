Some random fun facts about me:
* I have lived in three different states and moved nine times in a little over the past decade.
* I can play both the piano and the violin (I'm a little out of practice, however.)
* I am a huge nerd, especially when it comes to anything *Five Nights at Freddy's* related.
* I have two dogs, Walter and Clyde. Walter is a Wheaten Terrier and Clyde is a Dachshund/Miniature Schnauzer mix.
